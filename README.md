# SMILES-Reinforcement-Learning-Model
Repository implements a SMILES-based reinforcement learning framework to quantify visual complexity of organic molecules. It extracts molecular descriptors via RDKit, trains an RL agent to rank diagrams by complexity using human feedback, and evaluates alignment via Levenshtein distance.
